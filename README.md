## About The Project

[![Artboard][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A little project I made while learning React. It was my spin to [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSxgVLtIB0IFmQGuVMSE_wDHPW5rq4Ik7) awesome tutorial. The idea was to have an online notebook in hand-drawn style. I was going to expand it with more features but I discontinued the project.
