## About The Project

![Artboard](https://github.com/shocquu/sketchy-reactjs/blob/main/assets/sketchy.png?raw=true)

A little project I made while learning React. It was my take on this excellent tutorial. The idea was to have an online notebook in a hand-drawn style. I was going to expand it with more features, but I discontinued the project.
